problem

 we are publising before subscribing to the accepted or rejected topic

 race condition

 fix:

 The issue you're encountering is a common challenge when working with MQTT and AWS IoT Core shadows. The core of the problem is that sometimes the MQTT publish to the shadow `/get` topic occurs **before** your subscriptions to the `/get/accepted` and `/get/rejected` topics are fully established. As a result, you might miss the response messages because your application isn't ready to receive them yet.

**Understanding the Problem**

In MQTT, there is no built-in guarantee that a subscription is immediately active after you call the subscribe method. This can lead to a race condition where you publish a message before your subscription is ready, causing you to miss incoming messages that are sent in response to your publish.

Here's what's happening in your scenario:

1. **Subscription Delay**: When you subscribe to the `/get/accepted` and `/get/rejected` topics, there's a slight delay before the subscription becomes active.
2. **Immediate Publish**: You publish an empty message to the `/get` topic to request the shadow state immediately after initiating the subscriptions.
3. **Missed Messages**: If the shadow service responds quickly, it might publish the response to `/get/accepted` or `/get/rejected` before your subscriptions are active, causing you to miss the response.

**Current Workaround**

Your temporary fix involves re-publishing the message before and after the subscription, ensuring that at least one of the publishes occurs after the subscription is active. While this can work, it's not the most efficient or reliable solution.

**Improving the Implementation**

To address this problem effectively, you need to ensure that you only publish to the `/get` topic **after** your subscriptions to `/get/accepted` and `/get/rejected` are fully established.

Here are steps to improve your implementation:

1. **Wait for Subscription Acknowledgment**

   Unfortunately, the AWS Amplify PubSub library doesn't provide a direct way to know when a subscription is fully established. However, you can use the connection state monitoring via the `Hub` module to listen for connection state changes.

   ```javascript
   import { CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE, ConnectionState } from '@aws-amplify/pubsub';
   import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify';

   let isConnected = false;

   Hub.listen('pubsub', (data) => {
     const { payload } = data;
     if (payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE) {
       const connectionState = payload.data.connectionState;
       if (connectionState === ConnectionState.Connected) {
         isConnected = true;
       }
     }
   });
   ```

   However, this only tells you about the overall connection state, not the subscription state.

2. **Chain Subscriptions and Publishing**

   Modify your code to ensure that the publish to `/get` only happens **after** the subscriptions are confirmed. Since the PubSub library returns an observable, you can leverage it to know when the subscription is active.

   ```javascript
   const subscribeToShadowGetAccepted = () => {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       try {
         pubSub.subscribe({ topics: [TOPICS.shadow.getAccepted] }).subscribe({
           next: (data) => {
             console.log('Accepted data received:', data);
             // Handle data...
           },
           error: (error) => {
             console.error('Subscription error:', error);
             reject(error);
           },
           complete: () => {
             console.log('Subscription to getAccepted completed');
           },
         });
         resolve();
       } catch (error) {
         reject(error);
       }
     });
   };

   // Do the same for getRejected...

   const setupSubscriptionsAndPublish = async () => {
     try {
       await subscribeToShadowGetAccepted();
       await subscribeToShadowGetRejected();
       // Subscriptions are now set up; proceed to publish
       await pubSub.publish({
         topics: [TOPICS.shadow.get],
         message: {},
       });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error setting up subscriptions or publishing:', error);
     }
   };

   useEffect(() => {
     setupSubscriptionsAndPublish();
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Introduce a Delay**

   As a workaround, you can introduce a small delay between subscribing and publishing to ensure that the subscriptions are active.

   ```javascript
   const setupSubscriptions = async () => {
     // Subscribe to topics
     await subscribeToShadowGetAccepted();
     await subscribeToShadowGetRejected();

     // Wait for a short period to ensure subscriptions are active
     await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

     // Now publish to the get topic
     await pubSub.publish({
       topics: [TOPICS.shadow.get],
       message: {},
     });
   };
   ```

   This is not the most elegant solution but can be effective.

4. **Handle Missed Responses with Retries**

   Implement a mechanism to detect if a response was not received within a certain timeout and retry the publish.

   ```javascript
   const RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // Adjust as needed

   const publishWithTimeout = async () => {
     let responseReceived = false;

     const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
       if (!responseReceived) {
         console.warn('No response received, retrying publish...');
         publishWithTimeout(); // Retry publishing
       }
     }, RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS);

     await pubSub.publish({
       topics: [TOPICS.shadow.get],
       message: {},
     });

     // In your subscription handlers:
     // On receiving data:
     responseReceived = true;
     clearTimeout(timeout);
   };
   ```

5. **Use a More Robust MQTT Client**

   If possible, consider using a lower-level MQTT client that gives you more control over the subscription acknowledgments (SUBACK) and the timing of your publish operations. Libraries like [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) allow you to listen for when a subscription is acknowledged before proceeding.

---

**Explanation of the Problem Terms**

- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: A lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks.

- **AWS IoT Shadow**: A JSON document used to store and retrieve current state information for a device. Shadows provide a reliable data store, making it easier to build applications that interact with devices.

- **Publish/Subscribe Model**: A messaging pattern where publishers send messages to topics without knowledge of subscribers, and subscribers receive messages of topics they're interested in.

- **Race Condition**: An undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.

- **Subscription Acknowledgment (SUBACK)**: In MQTT, when a client subscribes to a topic, the broker sends back a SUBACK message to acknowledge the subscription.

---

**Conclusion**

Given the limitations of the AWS Amplify PubSub library, your current implementation is a reasonable approach. However, you can improve it by ensuring that you only publish to the `/get` topic after your subscriptions are fully established. Introducing a small delay or handling the lack of response with retries are practical solutions.

If you require more precise control, consider using a different MQTT client library that allows you to handle subscription acknowledgments explicitly. This way, you can be certain that your subscriptions are active before publishing messages that expect a response.

**Revised Code Example**

Here's how you might revise your code to incorporate these improvements:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { TOPICS } from "../../constants/mqtt-topics";
import { usePubSubContext } from "../../context/PubSubContext";

export function RelayStatusContainer() {
  const pubSub = usePubSubContext();
  const [relayShadow, setRelayShadow] = useState(null);
  const [responseStatus, setResponseStatus] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscribeToShadowTopics = async () => {
      try {
        // Subscribe to get/accepted
        await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          pubSub.subscribe({ topics: [TOPICS.shadow.getAccepted] }).subscribe({
            next: (data) => {
              console.log("Accepted data received:", data);
              setResponseStatus("accepted");
              setRelayShadow(data);
            },
            error: (err) => {
              console.error("Error subscribing to getAccepted:", err);
              reject(err);
            },
            complete: () => {
              console.log("Subscription to getAccepted completed");
            },
          });
          resolve();
        });

        // Subscribe to get/rejected
        await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          pubSub.subscribe({ topics: [TOPICS.shadow.getRejected] }).subscribe({
            next: (data) => {
              console.log("Rejected data received:", data);
              setResponseStatus("rejected");
            },
            error: (err) => {
              console.error("Error subscribing to getRejected:", err);
              reject(err);
            },
            complete: () => {
              console.log("Subscription to getRejected completed");
            },
          });
          resolve();
        });

        // Wait briefly to ensure subscriptions are active
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

        // Publish to shadow/get
        await pubSub.publish({
          topics: [TOPICS.shadow.get],
          message: {},
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error in subscription setup or publishing:", error);
      }
    };

    subscribeToShadowTopics();
  }, [pubSub]);

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Relay Shadow Status</h2>
      {responseStatus ? (
        <p className="mb-2">
          Status: <strong>{responseStatus}</strong>
        </p>
      ) : (
        <p className="mb-2">Loading shadow status...</p>
      )}
      {relayShadow && (
        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          {JSON.stringify(relayShadow, null, 2)}
        </pre>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- **Sequential Subscription Setup**: Subscriptions to `/get/accepted` and `/get/rejected` are set up sequentially, ensuring they're both established before proceeding.
- **Delay Before Publishing**: Introduced a brief delay (`setTimeout`) to help ensure that subscriptions are active before publishing.
- **Simplified State Management**: Removed unnecessary state variables to focus on the core functionality.

---

**Final Thoughts**

While there might not be a perfect solution due to the limitations of the library, these adjustments should improve the reliability of your application. Always ensure that your subscriptions are active before publishing messages that rely on responses to prevent missing any crucial data.
